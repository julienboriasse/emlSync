> The remains of a huge sea creature with enormous teeth that could have =

>=20
> Ichthyosaurs were large marine reptiles with an elongated, snakey =
shape. They first emerged after the end of the Permian extinction, an =
event also known as the =E2=80=9Cgreat dying=E2=80=9D =
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/06/global-warming-extinc=

which wiped out more than two-thirds of species on land and 96% of =
marine species.
>=20
> The toothy beast is one of three giant ichthyosaurs discovered in the =
Swiss Alps and is thought to have lived during the late Triassic period, =
about 205m years ago =E2=80=93 potentially making them some of the last =
such behemoths.
>=20
> The team said the findings helped resolve the conundrum of whether =
giant ichthyosaurs, like some smaller species of the creatures, had =
teeth.
>=20
> Prof Martin Sander, of the University of Bonn, a co-author of the =
study, said: =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s all very, very scanty evidence. We =
have these ghosts swimming in the late Triassic oceans for tens of =
millions of years, and we don=E2=80=99t know what they look like. It=E2=80=
=99s an embarrassment for palaeontology.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CFor a while we thought they had teeth. Then we thought, well, =
we never find any teeth. Now we have the tooth of a giant and a giant =
tooth. So some of them have teeth.=E2=80=9D
>=20
>=20
> Whale-sized ichthyosaurs, right, are thought to have occasionally =
visited shallow waters. Photograph: Jeannette R=C3=BCegg/Heinz =
Furrer/University of Zurich
> Writing in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology =
<https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?journalCode=3Dujvp2=
0> the team describe how they discovered fossils from three giant =
ichthyosaurs at different sites in the K=C3=B6ssen Formation between =
1976 and 1990.
>=20
> A fossil from one of the beasts was an incomplete tooth 10cm in =
length. The team found an enormous vertebra and rib fragments relating =
to another. The fossils of the third included seven large vertebrae. =
Sander said none of the remains appeared to be of known species of =
ichthyosaur.
>=20
> The team say the tooth, which lacks most of its crown, is only the =
second to have come from a giant ichthyosaur and is the largest ever =
found for such a creature, surpassing those of a species known as =
Himalayasaurus, which was discovered in China and is thought to have had =
a body length of about 15 metres.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CIchthyosaurs have a very characteristic tooth structure =
that=E2=80=99s visible in the root and also in the crown,=E2=80=9D said =
Sander, adding that the toothy giant discovered in the Alps probably =
would have eaten smaller ichthyosaurs and giant squid.
>=20
> Sander said one of the creatures appeared to have been about the same =
size as Himalayasaurus, while the other two, including the toothy beast, =
were probably similar in size to the giant ichthyosaur Shastasaurus, a =
creature found previously in British Columbia and that was about 21 =
metres long =E2=80=93 around two doubledecker bus lengths. =E2=80=9CThat =
skeleton had vertebrae that are the same diameter as the ones from the =
Alps,=E2=80=9D said Sander.
>=20
> But they are not the largest ichthyosaurs known to have lived. Among =
other finds, a toothless jawbone discovered in the Bristol channel is =
thought to have belonged to an ichthyosaur that was about 26 metres =
long.

> Shonisaurus, another member of the genus ichthyosaur from the Triassic =
period. Photograph: Stocktrek Images/Alamy
> While ichthyosaurs roamed around the oceans, the newly reported =
remains were laid down in what was once a lagoon, suggesting the beasts =
went into shallow waters. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s kind of the same problem =
when you get a sperm whale in the North Sea,=E2=80=9D said Sander.
>=20
> Dr Ben Moon, a palaeontologist at the University of Bristol who was =
not involved in the work, said it was possible the creatures might have =
entered shallow waters to mate or give birth. He said the new report was =
exciting as there were few fossils of giant ichthyosaurs.
>=20
> Dr Nick Fraser, a palaeontologist at National Museums Scotland, said =
it was difficult to determine the size of a giant ichthyosaur based on a =
tooth alonebut that the finds shed new light on the reptiles.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CUntil now we have suspected that most of the largest =
ichthyosaurs were toothless and were suction feeders,=E2=80=9D he said, =
adding that the size of the newly reported tooth was stunning.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CThe owner of this tooth was not to be messed with,=E2=80=9D =
said Fraser. =E2=80=9CAlong with remains of vertebrae and ribs, here is =
really concrete evidence that, in the past, Triassic waters sheltered =
some truly massive ocean-going reptiles, possibly as large as the living =
blue whale, and some likely had huge jaws armed with robust teeth.=E2=80=9D=
